<h1>Serendipity OA's Blacklist for Canadian FBA OA Sellers</h1>
This is a blacklist with over 300 websites that we have blacklisted for a variety of reasons including potential scam websites, non viable sources, sources that do ship etc.
Using this list in conjuction with the uBlacklist chrome extension will prevent these websites from populating in Google searches which can greatly increase sourcing efficiency for you and your team.

Note: uBlacklist does not block sponsored websites from appearing. Also note that once a website is included in your blacklist, you will no longer see that website in your Google search results. If you would like to access that individual site, you can still go directly to their website, remove them from your blacklist or turn off the uBlacklist chrome extension.

<h2>What is uBlacklist?</h2>
uBlacklist is a browser extension which prevents blacklisted sites from appearing in Google (or other select search engine) search results.

Get the Google Chrome extension <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublacklist/pncfbmialoiaghdehhbnbhkkgmjanfhe?authuser=1">here.</a>

<h2>General Info/How to Use</h2>
Websites can be blocked via uBlacklist individually and/or via a subscription. 
You can either copy individual sites from our blacklist and make your own in uBlacklist's settings or you can subscribe to our blacklist which will automatically update and add any new blacklisted sites automatically.
