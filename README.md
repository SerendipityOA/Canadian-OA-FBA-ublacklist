<h1>Serendipity OA's Blacklist for Canadian FBA OA Sellers</h1>
This is a blacklist with over 140 websites that we have blacklisted for a variety of reasons including potential scam websites, non viable sources, sources that do ship etc.
Using this list in conjuction with the uBlacklist chrome extension will prevent these websites from populating in Google searches which can greatly increase sourcing efficiency for you and your team.

<h2>What is uBlacklist?</h2>
uBlacklist is a browser extension which prevents blacklisted sites from appearing in Google (or other select search engine) search results.

<h2>General Info/How to Use</h2>
